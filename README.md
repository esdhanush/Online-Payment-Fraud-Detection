# Online Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent activities in online payments using machine learning techniques. With the rise of digital transactions, detecting and preventing fraud has become increasingly crucial for ensuring the security and trustworthiness of online payment systems. By analyzing transaction data and identifying patterns associated with fraudulent behavior, the project aims to develop a robust fraud detection system.

## Key Features

- **Data Loading:** Load transaction data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Exploration:** Explore the distribution of transaction types and visualize patterns using interactive charts.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Map categorical variables to numerical values and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training:** Train a Decision Tree Classifier model to detect fraudulent transactions based on transaction features.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy metrics on testing data to assess its effectiveness.
- **Prediction:** Demonstrate how the trained model can predict whether new transactions are fraudulent or not.

## Dependencies
